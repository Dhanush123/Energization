We are beings of energy. Matter, in fact, is merely a projection of underlying energy patterns. In this lesson you will learn a technique called the </span><span class="T4">Energization Exercises</span><span class="T3">, which will help you control your life-force. It would be hard to overstate the value of these exercises, which were developed by Yogananda specifically to teach us how to gain control over subtle energy (</span><span class="T4">prana).</span><span class="T3"> Yogananda said that if we were stranded on a desert island and could have only one yogic technique, we should choose the Energization Exercises, because through them we would eventually discover the entire science of yoga. </span></p><p class="P9"><span class="T6">As aspiring yogis, we should learn to see our bodies as the outward expression of elemental energy patterns. Our bodies, our health, our happiness, our very thoughts are determined by the level and direction of our energy. We should see our whole life as being like an image on a movie screen, simply patterns of light and dark. We have an enormously powerful tool to change ourselves once we grasp the fact that we are merely projections of energy patterns. If we create the patterns in our lives, then it is possible to </span><span class="T7">change those patterns directly. </span><span class="T6">With that realization we have in hand the secret key to the kingdom of God, for, in reality, all that is needed to find God is to release our identification with false images of who we are.</span></p><p class="P9"><span class="T3">In order to change something, it is much more effective to learn to control energy, which lies b</span><span class="T3">ehind matter, than to try to control matter itself. Once the pattern has become frozen into its outward manifestation it is much more difficult to change. Isn’t it much easier to adjust the </span><span class="T4">plans</span><span class="T3"> for a house than to move walls around once the house is built? </span></p><p class="P11">Consider this example. The introduction of computer modeling has totally transformed the way the aircraft and auto industries design and construct models of new parts. Formerly, once a new part was designed, a highly skilled craftsman had to produce a model out of wood or metal. If minor changes were needed, he had to craft the new part again and again until the new design was perfected. This process was repeated for thousands of parts. Now everything is designed with computer programs that create three-dimensional models on the screen. Parts can be matched to connecting pieces directly in the computer, where everything exists only as patterns of energy. If a physical piece is needed, it is created effortlessly by using light-sensitive plastic and computer controlled lasers. By working with energy patterns rather than physical models, the design time has been cut from years to months.</p><p class="P11">Scientists are even looking for materials, such as liquid metal, that can be formed directly into the various pieces required. Imagine an auto parts store which could produce, on demand, any part for any model of car ever made. All the necessary information would exist as energy patterns in a computer’s memory.</p><p class="P9"><span class="T3">We are not all that different from this example. We, too, exist as dynamic changing projections of underlying energy patterns. If we can learn to control our </span><span class="T4">prana</span><span class="T3"> and change the underlying patterns sufficiently, we can work miracles for ourselves and others. </span></p><p class="P9"><span class="T3">Here are just some ideas of the benefits of being able to control and harmonize the flow of </span><span class="T4">prana</span><span class="T3">.</span></p><p class="P21">In the Body</p><p class="P11">We can have boundless energy for work, relationships, and fun. When we become tired, we can recharge the body and mind instantaneously. We can have vibrant good health, since the cells in our body would always be highly energized. If we are injured, we can heal the injuries. Does this sound impossible? It wasn’t for Jesus or Yogananda or other advanced yogis. Does that mean we will never get ill? Not necessarily, but if we do get ill we can consciously direct sufficient healing energy to allow us to quickly regain our health.</p><p class="P21">In the Mind</p><p class="P9"><span class="T3">We can easily focus the mind on the task at hand, whether work or meditation. Success is guaranteed because we are able to apply the energy needed to overcome any obstacles in our path. We would have negative moods only rarely, and if they came, we would have a way of dealing with them, since our moods and thoughts are dependent upon our level of energy. We can find it much easier to overcome unwanted attitudes and habits. We can attract to ourselves the people and circumstances that we want: The laws of magnetism are directly related to the laws of energy. </span></p><p class="P21">In the Soul</p><p class="P9"><span class="T3">We can find it easy to go into deep meditation and quickly attain stillness of mind and openness of heart. Our devotion can have tremendous power and quickly attract the blessings of God and the masters. Our prayers for others and for the world can be powerful and effective. One time Yogananda and another devotee walked by Rajarshi Janakananda, Yogananda’s most advanced disciple, as he was meditating in the garden. As they were passing, Yogananda cautioned the devotee to be very quiet. When they were out of hearing, he said, “You have no idea what blessings are drawn to this work simply by having one person meditate that deeply.”</span></p><p class="P9"><span class="T3">Results like these are possible, but they are not easy to achieve. It all starts by learning to feel and direct the flow of </span><span class="T4">prana</span><span class="T3">. Yogananda discovered that, through will power, we can send energy to the various parts of the body. He then made this discovery practical by devising a system of body-cell recharging called the </span><span class="T4">Energization Exercises</span><span class="T3">.</span></p><p class="P6"> </p><p class="P22">Techniques</p><p class="P9"><span class="T3">These exercises are Paramhansa Yogananda’s unique contribution to the science of yoga. They use a combination of concentration, will, and breath to direct the flow of energy to various body parts. This flow is directed by tensing and then relaxing the muscles in the area we want to recharge. Paramhansa Yogananda explained that we draw </span><span class="T4">prana</span><span class="T3"> indirectly through the food we eat, as well as through oxygen and sunlight. These indirect sources of energy, however, are like the water you put into the battery of your car. When the battery runs down, no amount of water will make it work again. You have to recharge the battery from another source. Similarly, Yogananda explained, our bodies live only indirectly from food, but we live directly from the cosmic energy that flows into our bodies through the medulla oblongata at the base of the brain.</span></p><p class="P9"><span class="T3">The lips and tongue comprise the mouth of </span><span class="T4">man</span><span class="T3">, because this is where we eat in a physical way, but the mouth of </span><span class="T4">God</span><span class="T3"> is the medulla oblongata, inside the hollow point at the base of the skull. This is where we receive divine energy, which truly sustains us. It is from the medulla that we will send energy to various parts of the body by tensing and relaxing the appropriate muscles.</span></p><p class="P11">Paramhansa Yogananda gave us the axiom, “The greater the will, the greater the flow of energy.” Will power should be applied with intensity, but not grimly or with tension. It might help you to think in terms of willingness, enthusiasm, and joy. These Energization Exercises are a means of using will, with awareness of energy, to consciously draw cosmic energy into the body. As you do the movements of the exercises, try to feel the flow of energy and be conscious of that flow. Then, by use of your will power, you can direct the flow of energy to specific parts of the body. The more you become aware of using your will power to direct that energy, the more you will be able to increase the flow.</p><p class="P9"><span class="T3">By way of illustration: Close your eyes and gaze, as in meditation, toward the spiritual eye. Concentrate your attention in the area of the medulla. Now tense your right hand and forearm, feeling that you are sending energy from the medulla to your hand and forearm. Continue tensing harder and harder until your hand is vibrating with the effort. Now relax the muscles and feel the energy in the area you have just tensed. </span></p><p class="P9"><span class="T3">At first what you’ll feel is just the tension inside of the muscles. Then you’ll experience the flow of energy, which creates the tension in those muscles. Finally, you will become aware of how you can direct that flow. It may help to visualize a flow of light. It is important, however, to try to </span><span class="T4">feel</span><span class="T3"> the flow of energy. It is essential to concentrate as deeply as possible. Now repeat the same thing on the other side, tensing, and then relaxing, the left hand and forearm. </span></p><p class="P11"> </p><p class="P4">Key Points for Practicing the</p><p class="P4">Energization Exercises</p><p class="P13"><span class="T8">1. Concentrate on the flow of energy. Before beginning the Energization Exercises visualize energy coming into the body through the medulla oblongata (located in the indentation at the base of the skull) and flowing through the body. Once you’ve learned the exercises, try to keep your eyes closed with your gaze upward toward the point between the eyebrows. </span><span class="T3">This will help you to interiorize your consciousness and draw more on the superconscious. As you do the exercises, first concentrate on the center of the body part(s) that you are tensing and relaxing. Then, as you go deeper, your concentration should be </span><span class="T4">more on the flow of the energy</span><span class="T3">.</span></p><p class="P14">2. Use conscious will as you do the exercises. Through the use of your will, direct energy to flow into the appropriate body parts to energize the cells. Feel that, through the agency of your will, you are consciously drawing and directing the limitless stream of energy into your body. After tensing an area, completely relax and feel the results. Conscious relaxation after each exercise is very important. Tensing and relaxing not only recharges the body with energy, but even more important, it trains us to bring the flow of prana under our control.</p><p class="P14">3. Remember Yogananda’s axiom: “The greater the will, the greater the flow of energy.” This is a spiritual law. While it is better to think of will as “willingness” in order to avoid making it seem grim, you should use your will very intensely, especially during the tensing parts of the exercise. Remember: “Tense with will—relax and feel.”</p><p class="P13"><span class="T3">4. </span><a name="OLE_LINK303"/><a name="OLE_LINK302"/><span class="T3">Tense gradually, and relax gradually—from low to medium to high tension</span><span class="T3">. Never tense quickly, jerkily, or so hard that you cause physical discomfort. You don’t want to “strip your muscle gears.” Tense in a continuous wave—low, then medium, and then high with maximum tension, until the muscles vibrate. Hold the tension for up to three seconds. After tensing, relax completely—from high, to medium, to low, and finally to no tension.</span></p>
      <p class="P13"><span class="T3">5. Some of the Energization Exercises call for double breathing. Double breathing is a short and long inhalation through the nose, and a short and long exhalation through the nose and mouth. This double breath allows you to inhale and exhale more deeply and to increase the oxygenation of the blood. To practice a double breath, begin by inhaling strongly through the nose with a short, sharp inhalation, followed directly by a long, strong inhalation—completely filling your lungs. Then, without pause, exhale through the nose and mouth with a short, then a long exhalation—making the sound: “Huh, Huhhhhhh” (with the breath only; do not vocalize). Feel cosmic energy flowing into the medulla oblongata with the breath.</span></p><p class="P14">6. It is best to practice the exercises outdoors. If you are unable to do this, make sure you do them in front of an open window or door, where fresh air can enter.</p><p class="P13"><span class="T8">7. Practice the exercises every day at least once (and preferably twice) a day. Each exercise should be done from three to five times. Once you have learned all </span><span class="T8">the exercises, it should take 10 to 15 minutes to do them. </span><span class="T2">Energization can be practiced anytime, and it is especially beneficial before meditation to release tensions, and enable you to sit more still and go deeper in meditation.</span></p><p class="P15">8. Modify if necessary. If you have back, neck, or any special physical problems, or if a body part is ill or injured, modify the exercises for these body parts so as not to create discomfort. You might need to practice the exercises for these areas with low tension only, or even just mentally. It may be helpful to visualize a current of light flowing to the affected part.</p><p class="P13"><span class="T3">9. Isolate the body part being tensed. If you cannot isolate a specific muscle or body part, put your mind there and the energy will automatically flow to that part. Later you may be able to a</span><span class="T3">ctively locate and tense the muscles there individually.</span></p><p class="P13"><span class="T10">10. Try to do all the exercises. While you are learning them, you can begin by learning and practicing a few of the exercises at a time, until you’ve worked up to doing them all each day. You might try practicing the first five or so exercises for a week, then adding more the next week, and so on. There are visual and audio aids that you can use to help learn the exercises more quickly—the </span><span class="T11">Ananda Energization Exercises</span><span class="T10"> DVD, the </span><span class="T11">Energization Exercises</span><span class="T10"> CD, and our </span><span class="T11">Energization Poster</span><span class="T10">.</span></p><p class="P13"><span class="T3">11. Do the exercises with joy and willingness. Feel that you are giving your body a “breakfast of energy.”</span><span class="T19"> </span><span class="T3">You may want to keep this affirmation in mind as you practice: </span><span class="T4">Within me lies the energy to accomplish all that I will to do. Behind my every act is God’s infinite power.</span></p><p class="P48"> </p><p class="P16"> </p><p class="P6">Quotes on Energization</p><p class="P10"><span class="T4">from the</span><span class="T3"> Yogoda Lessons, </span><span class="T4">by Yogananda, copyright 1924</span></p><p class="P11"> </p><p class="P11">“Yogoda [Energization] teaches how to surround each body cell with the light of super-charged electrical vital energy, thus keeping them free from decay of bacterial invasion. It keeps not only the muscles, but all the tissues of the body, bones, marrow, brain, and cells in perfect health.</p><p class="P11"/><p class="P9"><span class="T3">“Yogoda brings about the growth of all the cells and tissues. It teaches how to recharge the body battery with fresh life current by increasing the will power. It gives specific methods to strengthen and recharge the muscles, not only collectively, but individually, with vital force. It establishes harmony between the working of the voluntary muscles and the involuntary processes. And this harmony gives wonderful health and strength.”</span></p><p class="P11"> </p><p class="P11">“Yogoda causes the resurrection of dying tissue cells and worn out facilities and the formation of billions of new cells and fresh facilities, all through the right exercise of will. Through it all the various tissues—bony, muscular, connective, nerve, etc.—are proportionately formed and the mind is strengthened. The circulation, respiration, digestion, and all other involuntary processes of the body are harmonized and invigorated; the mind is clarified.”</p><p class="P11"> </p><p class="P9"><span class="T3">“Yogoda teaches the art of consciously sending the curative life energy to any diseased body part. By its aid the general vitality of the body is markedly raised, resulting in a wonderful development of tissue, strength, and unexpected nerve vigor, thereby insuring greater longevity. Memory and brain power are also increased through greater blood supply.”</span></p><p class="P11"> </p><p class="P11"> </p><p class="P11"> </p><p class="P6">Routine</p><p class="P11">Practice the Energization Exercises either before or after your meditation.
